This plugin allows to make use of the Patience diff algorithm for generating diffs to use with Vim. This needs the git command line tool available.

You can also customize you setup to use any other tool to generated diffs (e.g. mercurial) Read the help on how to configure the plugin accordingly.

See the screenshots at https://github.com/chrisbra/vim-diff-enhanced

This plugin defines the following Ex commands:

:PatienceDiff - Use the Patience Diff algorithm for the next diff mode
:CustomDiff <algorithm> - Use <algorithm> to generate the diff. Use any of

    myers
    default
    histogram
    patience

After changing the algorithm, you need to run :diffupdate if you are in diff mode to regenerate the diff.
Note: Those 2 commands use internally git to generate the diffs. Make sure you have at least git version 1.8.2 installed.

:DisableEnhancedDiff - Disable plugin (and use default Vim diff capabilities).
